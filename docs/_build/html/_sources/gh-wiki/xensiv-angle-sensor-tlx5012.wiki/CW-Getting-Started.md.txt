### Overview

In this quick tutorial we will explain how to use the TLE5012B shield together with the Cypress WICED SDK, compile the provided example, and execute it.

### Required Software

* [WICED Studio](https://community.cypress.com/community/software-forums/wiced-wifi/wiced-wifi-documentation)
* [TLE5012B](https://github.com/Infineon/TLE5012-Magnetic-Angle-Sensor) (v3.0.0 or higher)
* for Windows: [PuTTY](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) Serial Terminal 
* for Linux: [miniCom](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Minicom)
* this library (Installed with WICED SDK)

### Tutorial

#### Software Installation

0. **install WICED Studio**. Download the software and follow the instructions in the following [website](https://community.cypress.com/community/software-forums/wiced-wifi/wiced-wifi-documentation). Registration is required.

1. **for Windows install PuTTY**. Downloadable from the official [website](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html) or use an other
sufficient terminal under your system.

2. **for Linux install miniCom**. Use your system installer (apt, apt-get, pkcon, zypper or similar). You can also use any other
similar software.

3. **install the TLE5012B library**. Follow the steps in the [WICED Lib Installation](CW-Lib-Installation) section. 


#### Hardware Setup

The TLE5012B needs to be connected to the mcu, so see into [TLE5012B manual](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-Angle_Sensor_TLE5012B-UM-v01_02-en-UM-v01_02-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d46146d18cb40146ec2eeae4633b) for the chip pin layout. Alternatively you can also use a breakout board from a Sens2go kit. 
Then, simply connect it to the computer with the USB cable. If you are using the Cypress 43xxx boards.
See also the [trouble shooting guide](CW-Troubleshooting-Guide).


#### Ready To Go!

With the hardware connected, the software installed, and the several [bugs fixing](CW-Troubleshooting-Guide) changes made to the SDK, the example can be finally built and run:

1. **Example sensorType**

   Open the ifx example (*apps/ifx/TLE5012B/sensorType*).

2. **Terminal output**

   Open the PuTTY serial terminal with 115200 baud, 8-N-1, and the appropriate COM port (or *tty* device).

   <img src="img/putty-conf.png" height="380px">

   You will get the bit setting of all of the sensor registers, the default interface type and the setting of some main
   DSP registers. This information is important if you want to know in which range your TLE5012B sensor is working at best.
   This programm will only fetch a senseful output if a magnetic field is near the sensor. Otherwise the *checkerror* is
   set and no output will be generated.

3. **WICED make target**

   Create target *"ifx.TLE5012B.sensorType-CYW943907AEVAL1F download run"* and click on it. 

   <img src="img/make-target.png" height="300px">

   The terminal will soon prompt the *TLE5012B* ready message and prints out the next operation on the motor.
   If everything is connected, the motor should run up and down, forward and backward (if capable of).

4. **Example readAngleValueProcessing**

   Open the ifx example (*apps/ifx/TLE5012B/readAngleValueProcessing*) and run it. It will constantly readout the angle value.
   If you know use you magnet in front of the sensor and turn it, you can see how the value are changing.
